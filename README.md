# Hi, I'm <b>Edwin</b> ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior at Bowdoin College studying <b>Mathematics</b> and <b>Computer Science</b>. I'm passionate about building innovative technological solutions that solve real world problems. I believe that technology has the power to make a positive impact on society, and I'm committed to using my skills to make a difference.

## What I Bring to the Table

Through my experience as a <i>Network Engineer</i>, <i>Web Developer</i>, <i>Process Improvement &amp; Automations intern</i>, and <i>Data Scientist</i>, I have developed a diverse skill set and learned to approach problems thoughtfully and collaboratively. I am cognizant of deadlines and able to work under pressure.

I possess <i>spirited optimism</i>, strong communication skills, and an aptitude for problem solving. I am able to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges. I enjoy working with others and believe that collaboration is key to building successful products.

## Personal Projects and Interests

In my spare time, I am currently working on reconstructing 21 years of violence in Mexico by combining my personal memories with the accounts that have been contested in local journalism. In collaboration with the Math and CS department at Bowdoin, I am investigating the interrelatedness of cartel homicides, kidnappings, extortions, and disappearances through comprehensive data analysis in Python and R. This project has been a remarkable opportunity for me to apply my technical skills to a critical real-world problem, and it has reinforced my firm belief in the power of math and technology to unveil complex issues that may have remained obscured.

## My Mission

I seek to work in mission-driven environments where the purpose is to deliver quality products that enable and empower society. I'm excited about the possibility of working on projects that have a positive impact on people's lives, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
